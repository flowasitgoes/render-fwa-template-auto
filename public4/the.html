While people with HAE have reported various triggers of attacks, emotional stress, physical stress, and dental procedures are the most commonly reported triggers. HAE may be caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) in the C1NH gene (also called the SERPING1 gene) or in the F12 gene. In some cases, the cause is not yet known.

The genes, including the CDKN1C, H19, IGF2, and KCNQ1OT1 genes, are located on chromosome 11. In most cases BWS is caused by problems with the genomic imprinting of these genes. Genomic imprinting refers to having some genes that are active (expressed) only when inherited from the father and others that are active only when inherited from the mother. Less commonly, changes in the CDKN1C gene or larger changes to chromosome 11, such as a translocation, deletion, or duplication, may cause BWS.

The symptoms associated with XLP vary from person to person, and even among family members. XLP generally has two subtypes, which are caused by genetic changes in different genes: XLP1 is mainly characterized by an inappropriate immune response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, leading to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or severe mononucleosis; dysgammaglobulinemia; and lymphoproliferative disease (malignant lymphoma). XLP2 is usually characterized by HLH (often associated with EBV), dysgammaglobulinemia, and inflammatory bowel disease (colitis). People with XLP2 have not been known to develop lymphoma. Signs and symptoms of HLH include fever, enlarged lymph nodes and spleen, skin rashes, and problems with the lungs, digestive system, liver, and nervous system. The heart, kidneys, or other organs may also be affected. Mononucleosis may cause fatigue; fever; an inflamed and sore throat; enlarged lymph nodes, liver, and spleen; and symptoms of anemia. Dysgammaglobulinemia causes an increased risk of recurrent infections. XLP1 is caused by genetic changes in the SH2D1A gene, and XLP2 is caused by genetic changes in the XIAP gene. Inheritance is X-linked recessive. However, in rare cases, females with a genetic change on one copy of the responsible gene develop symptoms of XLP. A diagnosis of either type of XLP can be confirmed with genetic testing.

Early symptoms may include muscle twitching, cramping, stiffness, or weakness, slurred speech, and/or difficulty chewing or swallowing. As the disease progresses, people may become weaker and are eventually wheelchair-dependent. Most people with ALS have a sporadic (not inherited) form of ALS. It is believed that these cases are caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. This means that a person may have inherited genetic changes (pathogenic variants) that increase their risk to develop ALS, but the person will only develop ALS if exposed to certain environmental triggers. About 10% of the people with ALS have at least one relative with the disease and are said to have have a familial (inherited) form of the disease (FALS). Familial ALS may be caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants) in any one of several genes and the pattern of inheritance varies depending on the gene involved.

In some types of SMA, the loss of motor neurons makes it hard to control movement of the hands and feet.
